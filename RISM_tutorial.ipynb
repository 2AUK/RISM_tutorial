    "1000 iterations doesn't seem to cut it on my machine. We might need to implement a different solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a look at a simple convergence acceleration method called Ng acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence acceleration methods are a family of numerical methods that use the history of solutions to guide towards a new solution quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the Ng method is to save the previous 3 solutions and to use those to parametrise a new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets define a few things for bookkeeping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_n = t_k(r) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ g_n = F(t_k(r)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_n = g_n - f_n = F(t_k(r)) - t_k(r) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we save $n=3$ solutions, we have the variables $f_{n-2}$, $g_{n-2}$, $f_{n-1}$, $g_{n-1}$, $f_{n}$, and $g_{n}$ available to us. This is our history of solutions, and we will use these to guide our solver to a new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_n$ is essentially a residual of our system. We construct a linear system of equations to solve for coefficients that will be used to construct our new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define further the following residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{01} = d_n - d_{n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{02} = d_n - d_{n-2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we construct a matrix A\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\langle d_{01}, d_{01} \\rangle & \\langle d_{01}, d_{02} \\rangle \\\\\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ is an inner (or dot) product.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then construct a linear system $Ax = b$ where we solve for coefficients $x = x_1, x_2$. These coefficient can be used to construct a new solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{n+1} = (1 - x_1 - x_2) g_n + x_1 g_{n-1} + x_2 g_{n-2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{n+1} = t_{k+1}(r)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We test for convergence using the L2-norm $$ \\left\\Vert d_n \\right\\Vert = \\left\\{\\int \\left|d_n \\right|^2 dr\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\n",
